# ‚ú® [XRPL.org](https://xrpl.org) ‚ú®

[XRPL.org](https://xrpl.org) is a great resource for anyone wanting to learn more about the XRPL and how it works.

Feel free to [explore](https://xrpl.org/get-started.html) [there](https://xrpl.org/overview.html) [first](https://xrpl.org/introduction.html)!
([It's](https://xrpl.org/send-a-multi-signed-transaction.html) [really](https://xrpl.org/references.html) [good](https://xrpl.org/technical-faq.html) üò≥)

To come back here anytime you want ‚Äì just remember the [**xrpl.rocks**](https://xrpl.rocks)! üéâ

# Conventions

The XRPL is a [decentralized](https://xrpl.org/consensus.html), [immutable](https://xrpl.org/modifying-the-ledger.html),
[censorship-resistant](https://xrpl.org/transaction-queue.html), distributed-ledger.
It is also near instant, and the daemon itself is capable of websockets.

Most projects include an active view of current transactions occuring on the network.

Here are some things to know:

- <kbd>M</kbd><kbd>T</kbd><kbd>D</kbd><kbd>H</kbd> = Multi-environment.

## More Coins!! We need Help Listing them all!

We recently had a great amount of interest in issuing tokens through tools and services, like [XUMM.community](https://xumm.community)'s token issuer and now xApp 
through the [XUMM Wallet](https://xumm.app).

One resource made by a community member, ([@gaget78](https://twitter.com/gadget78)) is a spreadsheet of tokens that contain a lot of useful information, and a credit-like rating.

Some basic things that are desirable, which also align with requirements [for being listed within XUMM.app](https://support.xumm.app/hc/en-us/articles/4405548600466-How-do-I-get-an-issued-token-listed-in-XUMM-display-name-icon-), and are also listed at the end of [XUMM.Community Token Creator xApp](https://xumm.app/detect/xapp:nixer.tokencreate) are: 

- Issuing account is "blackholed" ([the root key is removed](https://xrpl.org/disable-master-key-pair.html))
- There's a known team (non-anoymous developers) behind the project

### XRPL Token Ratings

- [Gadget78's Spreadsheet](https://gadget78.co.uk) - A spreadsheet that started as a list of tokens. Now offers much more, including a rating and information not available directly through the XRPL; meticulously gathered and put together through Gadget78, and the twitter community of researchers that provide them information.

# I want to run a Node üèóÔ∏è

I want to run a node and be a participant in the XRPL.

Want to skip ahead? Use the [developer tools](#xrpl-developer-tools) and a [public node](#i-need-a-node-to-connect-to-).

## The Daemon ‚Äì `rippled`

> a daemon (/ÀàdiÀêm…ôn/ or /Ààde…™m…ôn/) is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user

[`rippled`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/) _This is the core of the XRPL_, it's a peer to peer network daemon.

###### ‚Ä¶maybe we rename it `xrpld` üòé

## Installing, Configuring and Running `rippled`
- [XRPL.org Installing `rippled`](https://xrpl.org/install-rippled.html) Install and get the core running, its easy! 
  (Like just install a package or run a container easy.)
- [XRPL.org Configuing `rippled`](https://xrpl.org/configure-rippled.html) Next steps after you get it installed and running.
- [Node Configurator](https://xrplf.github.io/xrpl-node-configurator/) - ü™Ñ‚ú® This wizard will walk you through configuring a node!
  If you want to go full custom. The [shipped, example configuration file](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/7bd5d51e4e4e76a5547051d30b330739618eddb0/cfg/rippled-example.cfg)
  is pretty verbose about each option, this wizard will
  package you up your validators, your config and even instructions in a zip you generate locally.
- [IANA Registration for `xrpl` service port](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml?search=2459) `2459` registerd with IANA as the peer port protocol. [via](https://xrpl.org/peer-protocol.html#peer-protocol-port)
  
See [XRPL Developer Tools](#xrpl-developer-tools) for connecting to your node or any other node, such as a public one like [XRPLcluster](https://xrplcluster.com).

### `rippled` in a üê≥ Container
- [rippled Docker container (node)](https://github.com/WietseWind/docker-rippled) - [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/xrptipbot/rippled/)
- [rippled Docker container (validator)](https://github.com/WietseWind/docker-rippled-validator) - [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/xrptipbot/rippledvalidator/)

### `rippled` on the Raspberry Pi 4

The RPi4 is ARM64 capable and can compile `rippled`, if you'd like to boot up an
[ARM 64-bit OS](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi).
The RPi4 @ 8GB meets the [minimum requirements](https://xrpl.org/system-requirements.html#minimum-specifications),
it could meet the [recommended requirements](https://xrpl.org/system-requirements.html#recommended-specifications)
with a bump to its' RAM to 32GB since it also has 1Gbps networking.


- [Running an XRPL Validator on a RPi4](https://write.as/dvilela/running-an-xrpl-validator-on-a-raspberry-pi-4)
  The [author](https://github.com/derkomai) has an installation script available
  [here](https://github.com/derkomai/xrpldRaspberryPi). This methodology can apply to compiling `rippled`
  on AWS Graviton EC2 Instances as well.
  
# I Run a Node üîß

I run a node and want to be a [good participant](https://xrpl.org/run-rippled-as-a-validator.html#1-understand-the-traits-of-a-good-validator).

If it's public, consider adding it to the [public node list below](#i-need-a-node-to-connect-to-).

## Broadcast Channels

# Wallets (Non-Custodial)

- üåü[**XUMM**][#xumm.app] üì± _Pronounced "sum"_ - XUMM is a self-custodial wallet for
  Android & iOS, built by [XRPL-Labs][#xrpl-labs]. XUMM can hold many accounts,
  and is easy to setup. It strives to deliver the best XRPL experience. It has
  several features not found in any other wallet, including Tangram integration
  and xApps which are vetted by the XRPL-Labs team.
  [XRPL-Labs/XUMM-App](https://github.com/XRPL-Labs/XUMM-App) is the source of

# XRPL Cross Blockchain

XRP is utilized to connect other block chains to the XRPL.
This is an intrinsic property of XRP, since it's a [scarce resource](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/f0e3383856a8923e55b0f10e7822de9031b7159e)
and the native token of the XRPL.


## Cross BlockChain / Sidechains
- üåü [A Vision for Federated Sidechains on the XRPL](https://dev.to/ripplexdev/a-vision-for-federated-sidechains-on-the-xrp-ledger-2o7o) 
  üó£Ô∏è This dev.to discussion and proposal is around federated sidechains.
  Federated `rippled` clusters allow for proving ideas out in production. 
  Transmission can happen across sidechains to or through the XRPL to other sidechains using [X-addresses](#x-address); 
  One could imagine standing up a private XRPL cluster in order to traverse through the mainnet. 
  One could do pretty much anything thinking of the federator as the gateway to and from a hub of value, 
  the XRPL would further enable the <abbr title="Internet of Value">IoV</abbr>.


## Cross Blockchain / Parallel Networks

These are networks that run in parallel to the XRPL, the XRP input into the network through various ways.

- [Wanchain](https://www.wanchain.org/) - a blockchain with a novel approach to node operation using SMPC
  or [Secure Multi Party Computation](https://www.explorewanchain.org/#/../technology/smpc)
- [Flare Networks](https://flare.xyz) - a blockchain that uses 
  <abbr title="Flare Consensus Protocol">[FCP](https://flare.xyz/flare-consensus-protocol-an-explainer/)</abbr>
  and is due to launch Q2/Q3 2021.
  XRP is collateralized according to the rate provided by the [FTSO](https://flare.xyz/ftso-a-breakdown/),
  [FXRP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ftqaiUgU7-57KEFzYQ807h9pwUzsE84Y/view?usp=sharing)
  is one of several assets that will be integrated with 
  [state connectors](https://docs.flare.network/en/state-connector).
